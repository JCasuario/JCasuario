ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Jorge Carretero, but all my friends call me Carre.

I used to work as a graphic designer, but recently I switched my path to web development.
Currently, I'm finishing my degree and focusing on learning enough JavaScript and TypeScript to start studying some frameworks. I'm eager to collaborate on public repositories where I can be helpful ðŸŒ±.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to send me an email at carreterogarciajorge@gmail.com ðŸ“§âš¡

<!---
ðŸ’»  Right now all my repositories are small projects where I try to apply all my knowledge or new featres that IÂ´m trying to learn!.
